# Symbolic Regression with Genetic Programming  

This project explores **symbolic regression** using **genetic programming (GP)**. The goal is to find mathematical expressions that best fit given data.  

The program evolves mathematical expressions over generations to fit data. It uses **genetic programming** with a tree-based representation of equations. Selection, mutation, and crossover help refine the solutions.
